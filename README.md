# Global-Trends---Tableau-Visualization<br />
Analyzing economic, demographic, and tourism trends using Tableau<br />

**📌 Project Overview**<br />
This project explores global trends in life expectancy, GDP per capita, population distribution, and tourism using Tableau. It leverages row-level calculations, aggregate calculations, table calculations, and insights reporting to build an interactive dashboard.<br />

**📊 Key Features**<br />
**1️⃣ Row-Level Calculations<br />**
Created a calculated field to project life expectancy by 4 years.
Converted the population field (millions) into a numerical format.
Displayed the Top 10 countries by projected life expectancy using a bar chart.<br />
**2️⃣ Aggregate-Level Calculations<br />**
Visualized total population (ages 15-64) per region.<br />
Displayed average life expectancy trends over time, segmented by region.<br />
**3️⃣ Table Calculations<br />**
Running Total: Line chart showing cumulative inbound tourism over time (2006).
Ranking: Ranked countries based on GDP per capita in 2006.
Stacked Bar Chart: Illustrated each country’s contribution to regional population totals.<br />
**4️⃣ Dashboard Insights & Reporting<br />**
Includes multiple interactive visualizations, each providing key insights:<br />

**📍 Countries with Highest Life Expectancy**<br />
Chart Type: Horizontal bar chart.<br />
Key Insight: Countries like Japan, Hong Kong SAR, and Switzerland have the highest life expectancy (>80 years), suggesting strong healthcare systems and economic stability.<br />
**📍 GDP Rankings (2006)**<br />
Chart Type: Table of GDP per capita rankings.<br />
Key Insight: Countries like Monaco, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein lead due to economic specialization and favorable tax structures.<br />
**📍 Population by Region**<br />
Chart Type: Treemap visualizing regional population distribution.<br />
Key Insight: Africa and Europe have the largest populations, while Oceania is the least populated.<br />
**📍 Life Expectancy by Region Over Time**<br />
Chart Type: Line chart tracking average life expectancy trends.<br />
Key Insight: Most regions show steady improvement in life expectancy, reflecting advancements in healthcare and living standards.<br />
**📍 Country Population Share by Region**<br />
Chart Type: Stacked bar chart.<br />
Key Insight: Asia, the Americas, and Europe dominate in global population distribution.<br />
**📍 Tourism Inbound Trends**<br />
Chart Type: Line chart of cumulative tourism growth.<br />
Key Insight: Increasing tourism numbers indicate economic growth, infrastructure development, and political stability.<br />
